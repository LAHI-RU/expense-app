## Getting Started

## ðŸš€ Deploying to Vercel (Recommended)

You can host both the frontend and backend for free using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Vercel supports monorepos and makes deployment simple:

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already).
2. **Sign up at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)** and connect your GitHub account.
3. **Import your repository** into Vercel.
4. When prompted, set up two projects:
  - **Frontend:** Set the root directory to `client`, build command to `npm run build`, and output directory to `dist`.
  - **Backend:** Set the root directory to `server`, build command to `npm install` (or `npm run build` if you have a build step), and leave output directory blank for Node.js.
5. **Set environment variables** for your backend (e.g., database connection string) in the Vercel dashboard.
6. **Deploy!** Vercel will build and host both apps. Youâ€™ll get live URLs for both frontend and backend.

**Note:**
- The provided `vercel.json` files help Vercel detect and deploy each part of your app correctly.
- Update your frontend API URLs to point to the deployed backend if needed.
